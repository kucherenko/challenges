# Calculator

Level: Beginner

Calculators are not only one of the most useful tools, but also a great way to understand the UI and event handling in an application. In this task, you will create a calculator that supports basic arithmetic calculations on integers.

The style is up to you, so use your imagination and get creative!

You cannot use the eval() function to do calculations

## User stories 

- The user can see a display that shows the current number entered or the result of the last operation.
- The user can see a notepad with buttons for entering numbers 0-9, operations - '+', '-', '/' and '=', a 'C' button (to clear) and an 'AC' button (to clear all).
- The user can enter digits as sequences of up to 8 digits by pressing the digits in the pad. Entering any digits longer than 8 will be ignored.
- The user can press the operation button to display the result of that operation:
the result of the previous operation and the last digit entered OR
The last two numbers OR entered
the last digit entered
- The user can press the "C" button to clear the last number or the last operation. If the user's last entry was an operation, the display will be updated to the value that preceded it.
- The user can press the 'AC' button to clear all internal work areas and set the display to 0.
- The user may see 'ERR' on the display if any operation exceeds the 8-digit maximum.

## Additional Functions.
