**Arkanoid** is a block breaker arcade game developed and published by Taito. Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the playfield. Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, creating several additional balls, or turning the Vaus into a laser cannon.

**The object of this game** is to keep the ball between the Vaus and the bricks.

## User Stories

- In Arkanoid, players maneuver a paddle-shaped craft named the Vaus along the bottom of the screen.
- The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, and attempts to bounce the ball against a number of bricks.
- The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. 
- When all the bricks are gone, the player advances to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears.
- There are game variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to assist the player (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, extra Vaus, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.
- On the final stage (33 on most versions, but 36 on the NES), the player takes on the game's boss, "DOH". 
- Once this point is reached, the player no longer has the option to continue after running out of lives, making this segment more difficult. 
- The game is over regardless of the outcome.

## Prize "capsules"

- Blue (E - "expand") - increases the platform by 2 times.
- Blue (D - "divide") - 2 more balls fly out of the balloon.
- Red (L - from "laser") - sets the platform with the laser, which can destroy the bricks with the laser.
- The pink (S is for "slow") slows down the ball.
- Purple (B - "break") - creates a portal on the right side, the transition to the next level.
- Green (C - "catch") - the ball now sticks to the platform.
- Gray (P for "player") - additional life.
