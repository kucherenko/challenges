## How do calorie counter apps work?

Calorie counter apps are programs that a person can download on their smartphone or tablet. Most of these apps are free, but some offer a premium membership at an additional charge. These apps help users record calorie intake and nutritional information. Some also have meal planners and barcode scanners, so individuals can input the information of the foods they eat. People can also find apps that offer workout videos and community support.
