# Emoji Translator

> Level: 2 intermediate 

Emoji have long been the language of international communication for modern society. They are a fun and fast way to exchange information and an incredibly expressive mechanism for conveying emotions and moods.

The purpose of the Emoji Translator application is to translate text entered by the user into an equivalent string of emoticons, translated from one or more words in the original text, and words for which there is no corresponding emoticon.

## User stories 

- The user can enter a string of words, numbers, and punctuation marks into the text box.
- The user can click the "Translate" button to translate the words in the entered text into the corresponding smiley face.
- The user can see a warning message if the 'Translate' button was clicked, but the text input field was empty or unchanged since the last translation.
- The user can see the text items in the entered text translated to the equivalent smiley face in the text output field. Text items for which there is no smiley face will be left unchanged.
- The user can click the "Clear" button to clear the text input and output field.

## Additional Features:

 - The developer implements an emoji synonym feature that allows the app to translate a wider variety of words into an emoji.
 - The user can select the language in which the input text is entered from the language drop-down list.
