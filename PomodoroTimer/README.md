# Pomodoro Timer

>Level - Begginer

**The Pomodoro Technique** is a popular time management method asks you to alternate pomodoros – focused work sessions – with frequent short breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental fatigue.

**The aim of this app** is to create a customizable pomodoro timer that works on desktop & mobile browser and to help users focus on any task they are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. 

The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student **Francesco Cirillo**. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.
