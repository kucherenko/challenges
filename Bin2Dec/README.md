# Bin2Dec Challenge 

> Level: Beginner

Binary is the number system on which all digital computers are based. Therefore, it is important for developers to understand binary mathematics. 

## Objective

The purpose of the Bin2Dec Challenge is to provide practice and understanding of how binary calculations are done.

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0 and 1, in any sequence and then display their decimal equivalent.

This task requires the developer implementing it to follow such constraints:

- Arrays cannot be used to store user-entered binary digits.
- Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in a sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, such as the natural logarithm. 
- The choice of function is up to you.

## User stories:

- The user may enter up to 8 binary digits in a single input field.
- The user must be notified if anything other than 0 or 1 has been entered.
- The user views the results in a single output field that contains the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number entered.
- The user can enter a variable number of binary digits.
