Implement project «Nutrition»

Nutrition apps provide tips on the nutritional value of food and help users keep track of calories they consume and control eating habits with healthy food recommendations.

## Functions that can be implemented in the "Healthy Eating" app:

- A calendar (a built-in calendar can track eating habits);
- A dashboard that displays calories consumed and calories burned, as well as the user's progress;
- The user's diet plan or goals (so that the user can create their personal diet plan and set weight loss goals based on their physical performance)
- nutrition data (by entering information about each meal, users can analyze how well they eat each day);
- photos (the nutrition app can recognize food in photos);
- calorie counter (this is the main function of the food control app);
- diet tips (this function is not mandatory, but will be useful for those who not only monitor their diet, but also want to lose weight).

## Common functions:

- Registration / Login (Users must be able to log in to the app).
- Social sharing (Users should be able to share their progress, such as weight loss, with friends).
- Pop-up notifications (Users should be able to receive reminders when they eat or start a workout).
- Blogging (Users should be able to blog about their progress and read the stories of others).
- Wearable device/activity tracker integration (The app should sync physical activity and health data so users get even more personalized advice).
- Shopping List (This feature allows users to create shopping lists).
