# ToDo App Challenge

**Task**: Write a ToDo application.

> ToDo List App is a kind of app that generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed. 

Your application might look something like this: [Brutask](https://app.brutask.com/3VvTJktsB1XSloI325wo)

## User Stories

In this version of the ToDo list, the user will be getting four options:

- The user can register.
- The user can add new ToDo items by entering text in the input box.
- By pressing the Enter key, the user adds a new item to the list.
- Each of the todo items has a checkbox in front of the todo text information.
- The checkbox can be used to toggle the completed state of each todo item. 
- If a todo item is marked as completed by activating the checkbox, the corresponding todo text is crossed out.
- The user can specify the time to complete the task in the line with the task itself.
- The application gives the user this option of removing todo items from the list: the x icon on the right to remove a single todo item from the list.
- The user can create his own team and add participants to it (optional).
