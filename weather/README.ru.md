# User story
To create a weather app, that is, a service that tells its users what weather they should expect in the next few hours, days, weeks.

# Weather app functionality

## Main functions:

 - weather forecasts (current weather in a specific location, as well as daily, hourly, and even minute-by-minute updates);
 - weekend forecasts (so users can think about the weekend with weather conditions in mind);
 - climate map (this feature will provide climate information such as humidity, air temperature, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels)
 - rain broadcast (the rain forecast is another important feature that shows the probability of rain along with a windy, cloudy or very cloudy indicator);
 - wind indicator (this feature is handy for users such as paragliders, kitesurfers, windsurfers and boaters. It provides vital information about wind speed and direction);
 - air temperature information in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit of the user's choice;
 - sunrise, sunset and moonrise (an essential feature of the Weather Forecast application is forecasting the duration of the day); 
 - the ability to select cities to monitor the weather (travelers appreciate this).
 
 ## Additional features:
 
 - weather visualizations (stunning visuals can be offered to make the app interesting. These eye-catching visualizations can help attract more users);
 - Ultraviolet Weather Map (this is another robust feature that is very useful in the summer. The Ultraviolet Weather Map provides the level of ultraviolet radiation from the sun over a certain part of the earth through the solar UV index);
 - Smart notifications (this feature can add significant value to your mobile app. Smart notifications can help users stay up-to-date or take action on weather changes);
 - animation of sunrises, sunsets, and moon phases (an animated weather app is much better perceived by the audience);
 - Drought monitoring (this feature is very useful for people involved in agriculture. It can help minimize losses caused by drought by alerting farmers in advance);
 - hyperlocal forecast (this feature is very useful for predicting thunderstorms, rain and other vital weather changes, it provides data with minute-by-minute accuracy while using the user's current location).

# The best tools for proper weather forecasting

Before you start building an app, you need to find a provider that will allow you to incorporate weather data into your app. There are several different providers for developing weather apps. Most include a free package along with premium subscriptions that scale based on services/features. There are a lot of professional sources, but we'll write about the best ones:

### Weather Underground API
https://www.wunderground.com/

The weather company has its own mobile service aimed at users who are interested in knowing the weather conditions. But the company does not ignore third-party developers who want to create weather applications, and offers them several API packages. What to choose depends on the specific situation and task.The weather company has a huge number of its own weather stations, so the task of getting the necessary data is simplified.

### Openweathermap API
https://openweathermap.org/api
Openweathermap API is another good option if you want to know how to make a weather application in a simple way.The module was created by enthusiasts who believe that meteorological information should be free and accessible. So they provide us with an open-source API to get current weather data.By the way, recently the module actively supports exporting meteorological data from their weather stations.

### AccuWeather
https://www.accuweather.com/

Advantages:The most complete database of forecast models from all over the world; 30+ years of experience in digital weather data processing; the largest and best real-time data set.

### Foreca API 
https://corporate.foreca.com/en/

Available information: current conditions, namely the latest measurements from official weather stations all over the world; artificial forecasts; Foreca Nowcasting solves the problem of station shortage (it happens sometimes, alas); its essence is the ability to artificially predict (using available data) the possibility of rain, heat waves, snowfall and other such things; forecasting for different time periods, starting from 15 minutes up to longer periods.

# For inspiration

### The Weather Channel
One of the most accurate weather apps. Provides weather forecasts for every hour, for 15 days and for the weekend. From the summaries you can learn about real and perceived temperature, wind speed, precipitation and ultraviolet light intensity.

</p>

### Weather Underground
The app can do all the same things as the other weather apps on the list, but it also has its own tricks: information about air quality and UV radiation levels in your city, about flu outbreaks or allergy threats. With webcams, the app allows you to see exactly what's going on in a particular city.

</p>

### Yahoo Погода
This is certainly one of the most beautiful apps on the list. "Yahoo Weather" constantly downloads gorgeous photos from Flickr and automatically selects backgrounds that match your location, time of day and weather conditions. It looks very spectacular. The app can show you the weather in up to 20 cities simultaneously. An interactive weather map, bad weather warnings, and beautiful animations of sunrise and sunset complement the usual information.

</p>

### YoWindow
A beautiful weather app with an interesting feature. Numbers and icons are located at the top of the screen, and the rest of the space is occupied by the landscape, depending on what is happening outside the window. Rain and sun, sunrises and sunsets, seasons change each other, just like in reality. By the way, the landscape can be selected and set as the wallpaper.

</p>

### CARROT Weather
CARROT Weather stands out for its abundance of black humor. No matter what's going on outside the window, the app has a snide commentary. Cynical remarks and jokes are also made about the user. Unfortunately, only in English. In addition, CARROT Weather is full of surprises. For example, the Time Travel feature allows you to find out what the weather was like in the past.

 <img src="photo_2021-01-07 22.52.46.jpeg" width="200"/>
</p>

### RANE°
There is nothing superfluous in this app. Only the forecast for the next five days with temperature, pressure and precipitation data. The design of RANE° is very simple and elegant. The animations are smooth and the controls are comfortable. RANE° is a good option for those who are tired of overloaded interfaces.
