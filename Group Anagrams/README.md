# Group Anagrams

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# User story

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

Approach 1: Categorize by Sorted String.
Two strings are anagrams if and only if their sorted strings are equal.

Approach 2: Categorize by Count
Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts (respective number of occurrences of each character) are the same.
